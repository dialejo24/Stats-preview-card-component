## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
-Responsive approach


### What I learned

i strengthened my responsive layout skills, i learned how to set a background-color to an image by using the ::before pseudo-element
i put in practice some grid attributes.
code snippets:

```css
.card__image::before {
  content = "";
}
```

### Continued development

i want to keep improving my responsive skills. i will continue using CSS grid in order to get used to that tool and 
i'll keep looking for new things so that i can make more interactive and beautiful webpages.


### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/) - This course by Wes Bos helped me to learn the most important aspects of CSS Grid, i'm still getting used to it, but it was an important resource that cleared many things for me.
